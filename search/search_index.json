Theoretical Foundation To derive the governing equations of motion for a projectile, we start with Newton\u2019s second law in a vacuum (no air resistance). The motion occurs in two dimensions: horizontal (x) and vertical (y). The only force acting is gravity, with acceleration $ g $, directed downward. Equations of Motion Horizontal motion : No acceleration, so: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ where \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of projection, and \\(t\\) is time. - Vertical motion : Acceleration is $ -g $, so: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Solving for Time of Flight The projectile returns to the ground when $ y(t) = 0 $: $$ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Factorizing: $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ Solutions: $ t = 0 $ (launch) or: $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ This is the time of flight. Range Equation Substitute the time of flight into the horizontal equation: $$ R = x\\left(\\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}\\right) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} = \\frac{2 v_0^2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)}{g} $$ Using the trigonometric identity $ \\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) $: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ This is the range as a function of the angle of projection. Different initial conditions ($ v_0 $, $ g $) yield a family of solutions, scaling the range accordingly. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) depends on \\(\\theta\\) through \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) : - \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) , i.e., \\ \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , so \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . - $ R = 0 $ when $ \\sin(2\\theta) = 0 $, i.e., $ \\theta = 0^\\circ $ or $ 90^\\circ $. - The relationship is symmetric about $ 45^\\circ $ (e.g., $ \\theta = 30^\\circ $ and $ 60^\\circ $ give the same range). Influence of Other Parameters Initial Velocity ($ v_0 $) : $ R \\propto v_0^2 $, so doubling $ v_0 $ quadruples the range. Gravitational Acceleration ($ g $) : $ R \\propto 1/g $, so a smaller $ g $ (e.g., on the Moon) increases the range. 3. Practical Applications This model assumes a flat surface and no air resistance, but it can be adapted: - Uneven Terrain : Adjust the landing height in the vertical equation, solving for $ t $ when $ y(t) = h $. This complicates the range formula. - Air Resistance : Introduce a drag force proportional to velocity (e.g., $ F_d = -k v $), turning the equations into nonlinear differential equations, typically solved numerically. - Real-World Examples : Artillery, sports (e.g., golf, soccer), or space launches (with modified $ g $). import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Constants g = 9.81 # gravitational acceleration (m/s^2) Function to calculate range def calculate_range(v0, theta_deg): theta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg) # Convert degrees to radians R = (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta_rad)) / g return R Angles from 0 to 90 degrees theta = np.linspace(0, 90, 181) # 181 points for smooth curve Different initial velocities v0_values = [10, 20, 30] # m/s Plotting plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for v0 in v0_values: R = calculate_range(v0, theta) plt.plot(theta, R, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s') Formatting the plot plt.title('Range vs Angle of Projection') plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (meters)') plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.show()","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#mechanics","text":"","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1-investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"To derive the governing equations of motion for a projectile, we start with Newton\u2019s second law in a vacuum (no air resistance).

In many real-world systems, forces like damping and external driving forces significantly influence the behavior of oscillatory motion, leading to a variety of phenomena such as resonance, chaotic motion, and quasiperiodicity. Understanding these dynamics is essential not only in physics but also in fields like engineering, environmental science, and biomechanics. Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum 1. Theoretical Foundation The motion of a forced damped pendulum can be described by the following second-order nonlinear differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Where: - \\(\\theta\\) is the angular displacement, - \\(\\gamma\\) is the damping coefficient, - \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration, - \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum, - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the driving force, - \\(\\omega\\) is the frequency of the driving force. Small-Angle Approximation For small angles ( \\(\\theta \\ll 1\\) ), we can approximate \\(\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta\\) , leading to the following simplified linear equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a linear second-order differential equation with constant coefficients, and its general solution can be found using standard methods for solving linear differential equations. Solution to the Homogeneous Equation The homogeneous part of the equation ( \\(A = 0\\) ) is: \\[ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = 0 \\] This is a damped harmonic oscillator equation, whose solution depends on the discriminant \\(\\Delta = \\gamma^2 - 4 \\frac{g}{L}\\) . The behavior of the system depends on this discriminant: If \\(\\Delta > 0\\) (overdamped), the system returns to equilibrium without oscillating. If \\(\\Delta = 0\\) (critically damped), the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. If \\(\\Delta < 0\\) (underdamped), the system oscillates with exponentially decaying amplitude. Forced Response For a driven pendulum with \\(A \\neq 0\\) , the solution takes the form of a particular solution superimposed on the homogeneous solution: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\theta_h(t) + \\theta_p(t) \\] Where \\(\\theta_p(t)\\) is the particular solution. This particular solution can be found using the method of undetermined coefficients, which leads to a solution of the form: \\[ \\theta_p(t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (\\gamma \\omega)^2}} \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta) \\] Where: - \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) is the natural frequency of the pendulum, - \\(\\delta\\) is the phase shift between the driving force and the pendulum's motion. Resonance Condition Resonance occurs when the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) matches the natural frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) of the pendulum. In this case, the amplitude of oscillation increases significantly due to the constructive interference between the driving force and the motion of the pendulum. The resonance condition is given by: \\[ \\omega = \\omega_0 \\] In this condition, the system can absorb energy from the driving force efficiently, which can lead to large oscillations. 2. Analysis of Dynamics Now, let's explore how different parameters affect the dynamics of the forced damped pendulum. Parameters Damping coefficient ( \\(\\gamma\\) ) : Controls the rate of energy loss. Increasing damping reduces oscillation amplitude. Driving amplitude ( \\(A\\) ) : Affects the amplitude of the oscillations, with larger values leading to larger oscillations. Driving frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) : Determines the frequency of the external force. When close to the natural frequency, resonance occurs. Numerical Simulation We will use a numerical approach to simulate the dynamics of the forced damped pendulum for various values of the damping coefficient, driving amplitude, and driving frequency. The equation will be solved using the Runge-Kutta method , which is an efficient way to solve differential equations numerically. 3.
